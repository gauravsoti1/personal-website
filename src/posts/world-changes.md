##### they, them
- I don't like the pronoun trouble and people becoming too uptight or intolerant regarding it.
- I definitely like the inclusiveness it brings. I like the idea of everyone being equal
- This is something definitely my generation and the previous ones didn't do well. Many of us our homophobics. We did an absolute shit job at including transgenders  into the society, we made it so difficult for them to survive on both mental and economical levels. So, yes the inclusiveness for everyone is a very welcome change and I am looking forward to seeing how the world changes for the better after this.

##### new technologies which actually make life better
- technologies in healthcare that make like of disabled people better or improve the chances of healing an illness, that's so great. The level we have reached now and the place we are headed, I feel very optimistic about it.
- People have outdone themselves, being so intelligent, it must take a lot of dedication and many years of people's lives to be able to do real innovation. So thankful and in awe of them.

##### social media and helpful information
- All I wanna say about social media right now is that in many areas of my life, it has made things great. I have muscle imbalances, tightness etc, I got to know about this and how to start treating it from social media. It gives me hope that I don't have to live in pain my whole life which I have seen that previous generation had gotten used to, especially in India.
- People doing amazing things are easily available, that's super inspring

##### focus on mental health, spreading positivity
- Focusing on being nice to others and not just being selfish all the time, just wow. I would like to think that this would only improve in the future and it's just absolutely amazing, the kind of things we would be able to achieve that way.
