##### Introduction
I absolute hate anxiety, fear and isecurity. They are really shitty emotions. As I have grown older, taken on new challenges, went through tough situations anxiety and fear are crippling.

Many times because of fear, I haven't done something that I should be. Fear definitely plays a huge role in being able to study for my work as well. Because of fear of failure, many times I try not to do something like learning a new skill or applying to that job. Ironically, those actions actually end up making me fail at that task, so that fear of failure emotion didn't really help me. 

Insecurity, feeling of being less than someone, they make me feel so bad about myself. The kind of person I want to be in front of someone, I am not able to be because of the fear of judgement. I think this plays a huge role in my life. I don't know how to get better at this. But still some days are good, when I am feeling good about myself, it's much better, I am able to be myself more. When I am not feeling too good, it's not like I behave in a way that's different from my values, I just don't interact enough. I think it comes from the societal norm that people who talk less are more cool or they know better than you.
